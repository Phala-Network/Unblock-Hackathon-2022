# Unblock-Hackathon-2022

## Introduction
On this page, you will find everything you need to participant in the Phala bounties in the Unblock Hackathon event.

Phala Network is a Kusama/Polakdot parachain focusing on trustless cloud computing, based on Secure Enclave technology. Unlike conventional smart contracts, Phala Phat Contracts can:
- be privacy-preserving: you can store secret data like private keys, API keys, or privacy data in a contract;
- interact with HTTP services: you can build an Oracle or Telegram bot as a Fat Contract;
- run computation extensive code: you can build games and analytics jobs in Fat Contracts without block latency.
- connect to Key-Value DB: you can connect to storages like S3, 4EVERLAND, IPFS, Arweave to store information off-chain through HTTPS Requests

## Dates
- Start Hacking: 2022-11-01
- Duration: 17 days
- End of Hackathon: 2022-11-18
- Announcement of Winners: YYYY-MM-DD

## Hackathon Bounties
### Challenge #1
| Challenge | Winners  |
| --------- | -------- |
| 500 PHA   | First 50 |

Complete the [Oracle Workshop](https://github.com/Phala-Network/oracle-workshop) steps for the Beginner and Advanced Challenge. Phat Contracts are different than the typical EVM Smart Contract. In contrast, Phat Contracts are written in the Rust-based eDSL [ink!](https://paritytech.github.io/ink/) and compile down to WASM. Walking through this workshop and getting some hands on experience here will show you the basics of building an Oracle with cross-contract calls that can be valuable for entering into Challenge #2.

### Challenge #2
| 1st  | 2nd  | 3rd  | plus                              |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --------------------------------- |
| 5000 | 3500 | 1750 | 800 for each qualified submission |

Build a fully functional dApp with Phat Contract on Phala Testnet.

A qualified dApp should be useful to solve some real-world problems or bring fun to people. It should also utilize the unique features of Phala (privacy-preserving, computation-intensive, or with HTTPS requests).

#### **In addition, documentation and tutorial contributions are elegible to our [Bounty Program](https://github.com/Phala-Network/bounty-program).**

The contribution can be:

- Fixes or improvements on our [wiki repo](https://github.com/Phala-Network/phala-wiki-next)
- Published video tutorials on Youtube and Twitter (please submit an issue in the Code Bounty Program repo)
- Documentation or bug fixes in our [main repo](https://github.com/Phala-Network/phala-blockchain) or [JS SDK](https://github.com/Phala-Network/js-sdk)

## About Phala Network
[Phala Network](https://phala.network/) is a Web3.0 computing cloud that supports data privacy while remaining trustless. Unlike centralized cloud service, Phala doesnâ€™t own any server or data center. Anyone can provide permissionless servers into Phala Network, and because of a clever combination of blockchain and secure enclave, we can make sure the servers canâ€™t be evil even when they are in an edge network situation. Together, this creates the infrastructure for a powerful, secure, and scalable trustless computing cloud.
